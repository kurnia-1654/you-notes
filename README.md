# you-notes
YouNotes is a note application for create and save notes. 
It has functionality to create, modify, delete, and share note. 
But beacause it is a web based application, the functionality may not work in some browser. 

I have converted it into .APK that can be installed on Android. 
You can download the file from the Release Section.
